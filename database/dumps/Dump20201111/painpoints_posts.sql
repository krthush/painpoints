Summary: Have a home with a large plain of trees (user\'s choose their close friends to grow trees for), then if the user sticks to a goal they set (how often to stay in touch), the tree will be in either a state of blossoming, normal, or wilting/no leaves. The tree\'s also grow in size as the user messages the responding friends, so they also act as a method of giving an overview of who your close friends are. More discussion can be found in the facebook group, but due to the API flaw this idea is not practical.
